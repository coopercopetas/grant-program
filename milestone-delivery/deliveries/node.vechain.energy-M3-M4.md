## Milestone 3

Maintenance and Status-Page have one tangible delivery:

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------|-------|
| 3\.1 | Dedicated Nodes |  | future maintenance work, not tangible delivery today |
| 3\.2 | Virtual Node |  | future maintenance work, not tangible delivery today |
| 3\.3 | Status-Page | https://nodes.status.vechain.energy/ |  |

The status information was implemented into a generic node page that monitors other services too.

* https://de.node.vechain.energy represents the DE node
* https://us.node.vechain.energy represents the US node
* "Rotating Proxy to all available Nodes" represents the Virtual Node

## Milestone 4

The costs for the dedicated servers, AWS and CloudFlare are covered until 2025-07-01.
